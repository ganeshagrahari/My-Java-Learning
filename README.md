# My Java Learning Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository showcases my progress and the projects I've built while mastering Java, from the basics to advanced concepts like recursion, OOP, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

### 1. Java Basics
- **Syntax and Structure**: Getting familiar with the structure of a Java program, understanding variables, data types, and operators.
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, switch cases, and loops (for, while, do-while).
- **Methods**: Method definition, calling, and parameter passing.
- **Arrays**: Declaration, initialization, and operations on arrays.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Objects**: Understanding the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, creating classes, and objects.
- **Inheritance**: Learning about parent-child relationships between classes, method overriding.
- **Polymorphism**: Compile-time and run-time polymorphism, method overloading, and overriding.
- **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers and getter-setter methods to hide data.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.

### 3. Advanced Java
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive functions, understanding base and recursive cases.
- **Exception Handling**: Handling errors gracefully with try-catch blocks, finally, and custom exceptions.
- **Collections Framework**: Exploring lists, sets, maps, and queues using Java‚Äôs built-in collections.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files in Java using I/O Streams.

### 4. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java
- **Arrays & Strings**: Manipulating arrays and strings efficiently.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists, their implementation and usage.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Using stacks and queues, understanding their LIFO and FIFO behavior.
- **Recursion**: Applying recursion to solve complex problems, such as tree traversals and sorting.
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**: Implementing sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge) and searching algorithms (Binary Search).
- **Trees & Graphs**: Learning about binary trees, binary search trees, and graph traversal techniques (DFS, BFS).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving optimization problems using dynamic programming.
